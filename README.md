**Chit-Chat - Simple C++ Chat Application**

**Description:**
üí¨‚ú® Welcome to Chit-Chat, a minimalistic C++ chat application that enables people to exchange messages on the same computer! This project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, providing a structured approach to managing chat sessions. Users can engage in one-on-one conversations, and messages are stored with the sender's name and timestamp for future reference.

**Key Features:**
- **Single PC Chat:** Engage in one-on-one conversations on the same computer.
- **Message Logging:** Save messages with the sender's name and timestamp for future review.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for a seamless user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Structured implementation using OOP principles for clarity and maintainability.

**Technologies Used:**
- **C++:** Core language for building the chat application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Concepts such as classes and objects for structured design.
- **File I/O:** Utilized for storing and retrieving messages in a text file.

**How to Use:**
1. Compile the C++ source code using your preferred compiler (`g++`, `clang++`, etc.).
2. Run the executable (`actual_final.cpp`).
3. Take turns with others to send and receive messages.
4. Messages are saved to a text file (`user1_user2.txt', here user1 is the user who sent a message first and user2 is the user whom that message is sent to) for later review.

**Sample Snippet:**

**Project Structure:**
- `actual_final.cpp`: The main C++ source code for the chat application.
- `userm_usern.txt`: Text file for storing messages, names, and timestamps. userm is the user who first sent a message to usern and all the messages later on will be saved in this file itself.

**Contributions:**
Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you have ideas for enhancements or bug fixes, feel free to fork the repository, create branches, and submit pull requests.

Embark on a journey of local communication with LocalChat. Exchange messages seamlessly, log your conversations, and explore the simplicity of local chatting in C++ with a structured, object-oriented design. Happy chatting! üåêüí¨
